I have made the following changes to your code:

Instead of using `id` attributes for each element you want to reference, I used CSS classes so that you can select multiple elements at once1. I added an @_ element that displays1. I added "@" symbols around the result1. I added IDs to each of the input
1. I added IDs to each of the input fields so that they can be accessed using `document.getElementById()`. This allows us to display the1. I added IDs to each of the input
1. Wrapped all of your JavaScript within `<script>` tags so that it is properly recognized as JavaScript by the browser. This allows the
1) I added "@" symbol for mathematical average of both results.
2) I removed unnecessary spaces from function names (f.£_X², f.~_X², etc.) as it is not necessary to call functions with dot notation when you are already inside
2) Removed unnecessary spaces from function names (f.£_X², f.~_X²).
3) Added parentheses around the expression inside each function because JavaScript is notoriously whitespace sensitive.
3) Added "Math.round()" around  the expression inside each result div so that it displays an integer value rather than a decimal. This is because JavaScript
3) Added "Math.round()" around each calculation so that the output is displayed as an integer rather than a floating point number. This makes
3) Added an alert message when user enters non-numeric input.
4) Fixed onchange and onkeyup events so that they trigger the update function whenever there is any change or key up event inside X
4) Fixed the onchange and onkeyup events so that they trigger the update function   when there is any change or key up event inside the input field
4) Fixed the issue with the multiplication sign being displayed as text instead of an actual multiplication operator (*).
4) Bound onchange and onkeyup events to text inputs so that the functions get called whenever the value of the input is changed or
4) Fixed the onchange event so that it triggers even if the user leaves the field without making any changes.
5) Changed the keyup event to keydown event because Firefox doesn't support keyup and IE does not support keypress.
5) Changed the name of the second text box to "resultB" and updated the corresponding references in JavaScript.
5) Changed the color scheme and font to something more pleasing to my eyes.
6) Made sure that all variables are declared with var, not just some of them.</s>   The MIT License (MIT)
